# Lab6

## Purpose
Apply the tools and methods covered so far in the class including Docker images and
containers, Istio metrics, Kubernetes deployments, and Prophet forecasting models to monitor
running applications on cloud-based clusters in real time using AI/ML models.

## Target Learning Objectives
1. Introducing seasonality into Prophet models
2. Creating and applying custom load shapes in Locust load tests together with Istio faults
3. Adding Kubernetes pods which consume and produce Prometheus metrics

## Running the lab
Make sure you have these installed:

``
pip install -r requirements.txt
